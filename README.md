Unfortunately [webviewhs](https://github.com/lettier/webviewhs) is completely broken on Mac OSX Catalina.

So this is a simple template that uses stack Setup.hs to provide a *very* thin wrapper around the most recent [webview](https://github.com/zserge/webview) library. It will only work on OSX, and has only been tested for 10.15.4 as of the time of this writing.
